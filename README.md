## Tinymovr Motor Controller

This is the main repository for Tinymovr Motor Controller.

Tinymovr is an affordable motor controller for precise control of 3-phase brushless motors. Tinymovr is highly integrated incorporating an advanced MCU (Qorvo PAC5527), compact power stage, integrated absolute angle encoder (MPS MA702) and CAN and UART connectivity.
