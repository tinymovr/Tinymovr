[Tinymovr is an affordable motor controller](https://tinymovr.com) for precise control of 3-phase brushless motors. Tinymovr works with up to 38V input voltage, drives motors up to 40A continuous phase current, integrates an absolute angle encoder (MPS MA702) and features rich connectivity.

This repository holds the open source firmware, client library, hardware designs and documentation source.

### Documentation

[Documentation is available at Readthedocs.](https://tinymovr.readthedocs.io)

### Repository Structure

The master branch of this repository reflects the latest release.

Development takes place at the [develop](https://github.com/tinymovr/Tinymovr/tree/develop) branch.

We try to follow [A successful Git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) as much as possible.

The repository is organized as follows:

[firmware](./firmware/): Firmware for the PAC5527 MCU in Tinymovr

[studio](./studio/): Tinymovr Studio client software and library

[hardware](./hardware): Designs and drawings for related hardware

[documentation](./docs): Documentation source
