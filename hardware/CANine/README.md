# CANine CAN Adapter

This is a USB Type-C <-> CAN Bus adapter. Itself it is an adaptation of the [CANable board](https://canable.io/). It features DF-13 connectors in addition to 2.54mm header, as well as a convenient DIP switch for setting CAN termination resistor and boot mode.

This design is released under the original CANable license.

This directory also includes an STL model for a 3D printable case for the adapter.

There is also an [alternative case design available](https://github.com/ThotAlion/BLDC-design-help/tree/main/STL/USBCANBox) by ThotAlion.
