Gimbal Motors

Since firmware v0.8.4 and studio v0.3.4, Tinymovr can drive gimbal-style brushless motors.

What is a gimbal motor anyway?

Gimbal motors usually refer to 3-phase brushless motors whose stator is wound with many turns, and as such exhibits much larger resistance and inductance compared to the hobby-type brushless motors used in drones, RC cars etc. They are used in... well... camera gimbals mainly, because they offer smooth motion and require lower currents to produce torque compared to the 'regular' brushless motors, and as such can help minimize the size of the motor driver and associated hardware.
