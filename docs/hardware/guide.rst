.. note::
   Images in the documentation may refer to shightly different hardware versions. Where incompatibilities among hardware versions do exist, this is noted in the image caption.


Requirements
############

1. A 3-phase brushless motor (see below for supported types)
2. A means to talk CAN Bus, such as the CAN Adapter included in the Dev Kit or a Canable adapter.
3. A mechanical rig that ensures firm connection between the Tinymovr PCB and the brushless motor. Designs that can be 3D printed are available.

Note that the Tinymovr Dev Kit includes all of the above in an assembled kit.


Supported Motor Types
#####################

Most three-phase pancake-style outrunners can be used with Tinymovr. While there is a lot of variation between motors of even the same size and external appearance, as a general rule-of-thumb motors ranging from 40mm outer diameter to 110mm should work fine with Tinymovr.

Mechanical Setup
################

The most important aspect of a correct setup is to ensure the controller is properly positioned in relation to the motor. The center of the PCB, where the encoder is located, should lie as close to the motor rotation axis as possible. In addition, the distance from the encoder magnet to the encoder IC should be less than 2mm (less than 1mm if the magnet is on the back side of the PCB).

A series of motor, PCB and magnet mount designs are available to 3D print for various kinds of motor hole patterns.

.. note::
   For safety reasons, you should always ensure the motor&controller assembly are securely fastened to a stable surface before operation. The motor may experience high acceleration that may cause injury or damage.


Electrical Setup
################

.. warning::
   Tinymovr Alpha users: Please see :ref:`alpha-erratum-1`.

Electrical setup comprises three main parts: Motor connection, data connection and power connection. Below is a diagram with the electrical connection scheme.

Connecting Motor
################

Connect the three motor phases to the three terminals on Tinymovr. The order of connection is not important, motor direction will be determined during motor/encoder calibration.

The connection can be achieved in two ways. Either by soldering the motor leads directly on the terminals, or by securing the leads with a 2mm lug.

.. note::
   If using a lug connection, ensure that the screw and nut are not rotating against the PCB surface, as this may remove parts of the soldermask or even conductive copper layer.

Connecting Data
###############

Connect the CAN bus header to one of the two DF-13 sockets on the board. It is not important which one you choose. If this is a terminal node in the CAN network, flip the DIP switch labelled "CAN 120R" to on to enable the 120Ohm termination resistor.

Tinymovr Alpha CAN Bus Connector Erratum
****************************************

The CAN Bus Adapter that comes with Tinymovr alpha has the DF-13 pins reversed and as such is not compatible with regular DF-13 cables. Alpha users are advised to use the alternative pin header on the board and the included DF-13 to 2.54mm pin converter cable to communicate with Tinymovr, as shown in the diagram below:

Note above that the red wire should stay disconnected and to the left side of the board as viewed from the USB port side.

.. _alpha-erratum-2:

Tinymovr Alpha USB Micro Connector Erratum
******************************************

The USB Micro connector used in the CAN Bus adapter is unfortunately not very robust. In order to ensure that there is a good contact between the board and the USB cable, please ensure the male connector of the cable is firmly seated in the female connector of the board.

In addition, avoid exerting lateral forces to the connector (upwards or downwards) as they place stress on the soldered retaining flaps.

In the next iteration of the adapter it will be replaced with a USB-C connector.


Connecting Power
################

Tinymovr can be powered from a 12-26V power source. Connect the XT30 plug to the socket on the board. The LED near the center should light up.

.. note::
   The LED is not connected to the VBus rail, rather it is connected to the 5V rail coming out of the PAC MCU. A LED not lighting up indicates failure of the MCU power subsystem.
